Enrollment is the process where a device is registered with intunes so it can receive security policies, apps, and configurations.

Why we need enroll a Device?

⦁	To secure company data
⦁	To push apps and updates
⦁	To enforce compliance policies
⦁	To remotely wipe data 

How Enrollment Works ?

1.User or admin 
Via the intunes company portal or automatic setup (like Autopilot)

2. Device Register with Microsoft Entra ID 
This links the device to the organizations identity system

4. MDM certificate installed

Compliance Policies 
Compliance policies help create the rules and settings that users and devices must meet to be compliant
When combines with conditional Access, administrators can block users and devices that don't meet the rules.
Two ways use compliance Policies 
With conditional Access and Without Conditional Access
